## What our assignment does. 

Youtube video demo of project: 

https://youtu.be/tZ086k3-DtY

Our assignment creates 5 different audio visuals using the programming languange Java, Java processing and Papplet. The audio visuals are responsive to the music being played, the different sounds like the level bass etc.

* The 5 different visuals do the following:

1. Rose Pattern
2. Phyllotaxis
3. Dancing Circles
4. Box Generator
5. Noise Loop
   

## What are the controls.

To switch between the visuals you can click on whichever text-box you like and that is this visual that will show.

You can also use the numbers on your keyboard (0-4) to change between visuals.

The space key pauses the song and restarts it.

The escape key will exit the program immediately.

## How to run the assignment. 

Firstly open local terminal in desired folder.
Then run this command to clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Krys24/OOP-2021-22-Assignment
```
Now choose directory of the repo and check the origin and upstream remotes are set up correctly.
```bash
cd OOP-2021-22-Assignment
git remote -v
```
Now load the file into desired IDE (we used VSC) and click on "run" and then "start debugging" for the program to run and the audio visuals should automatically show up. 

* Please note that P3D does not work on Mac (M1) OS. To run the program on macOS just comment or delete "P3D" on line 41.

## What We're Most Proud Of

We are most proud of our own research and implementation of Java. We are proud of how the project turned out and we had a lot of fun making it. Also Phyllotaxis and Rose Pattern are pretty cool!

## Conclusion

In conclusion we found this assignment very fun yet challenging. It really allowed us to develop our Java skills but also our creativity. We are proud of the whole project and how it turned out as we ran into many difficulties and we overcame them by working as a team. 

We worked in a team of 3, we worked together on campus and also virtually and we believe that this assignment really improved our team-work and communicating skills. This assignment also tested and improved our problem-solving  and critical-thinking skills.
